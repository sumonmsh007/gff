<p>Four boys drowned in rough seas off the western Indian financial hub of Mumbai on Tuesday as India and Pakistan began evacuating people from coastal areas, two days before a cyclone is expected to make landfall.</p>



<p>Classified as a very severe cyclonic storm, Biparjoy is expected to land around Thursday evening between Mandvi in India&#8217;s Gujarat province and Karachi in southern Pakistan.</p>



<p>Meteorologists predict maximum sustained wind speeds of 125-135 km (78-84 miles) per hour, gusting to 150 km (93 miles) per hour.</p>



<p>&#8220;Four boys drowned at Juhu beach on Monday evening. So far, we have found the bodies of two, and the search is still ongoing to locate the remaining two,&#8221; said a police official in Mumbai, south of Gujarat.</p>



<p>High waves in the Arabian Sea, accompanied by heavy rains and gusting winds pounded Gujarat&#8217;s coastal areas, uprooting trees and resulting in a wall collapse that killed three people in Kutch and Rajkot districts, authorities said.</p>



<p>Eight districts in coastal Gujarat are expected to be affected, the state government said. Fishing has been suspended until Friday and schools have declared holidays.</p>



<p>Gujarat is home to many offshore oil installations and major ports in the country and most have been forced to suspend operations.</p>



<p>A 1998 cyclone killed at least 4,000 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in Gujarat.</p>



<p>Relief Commissioner Alok Kumar Pandey said that more than 20,500 people have been evacuated from coastal districts and the evacuation was expected to be completed by Tuesday evening.</p>



<p>In neighbouring Pakistan, paramilitary troops and local civil authorities also started moving people to shelters and relief camps, which were set up in schools and other government buildings, said Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman.</p>



<p>Ships and boats have been moved from some areas of Pakistan&#8217;s coast while hospitals in the region were put on high alert, added Rehman.</p>



<p>About 100,000 people will be evacuated by Wednesday morning, the chairman of Pakistan&#8217;s National Disaster Management Authority said.</p>



<p>Two of India&#8217;s largest ports, Kandla and Mundra, have suspended operations, the state government said. Other ports, including Bedi, Navlakhi, Porbandar, Okha, Pipavav and Bhavnagar, have also closed due to the cyclone, according to shipping sources.</p>



<p>Reliance Industries, which operates the world&#8217;s largest refining complex in Gujarat&#8217;s Jamnagar, declared a force majeure, suspending exports of diesel and other oil products from Gujarat&#8217;s Sikka port, traders said.</p>



<p>The Adani conglomerate&#8217;s ports business, Adani Ports (APSE.NS), said it suspended vessel operations on Monday at Mundra, India&#8217;s biggest commercial port that has the country&#8217;s largest coal import terminal, and also at Tuna port near Kandla.</p>



<p>The Indian Coast Guard said it evacuated 50 personnel from a jack-up oil rig off Gujarat&#8217;s coast named Key Singapore, which is owned by Dubai-based Shelf Drilling and currently working for Cairn Oil &amp; Gas, according to Shelf Drilling&#8217;s website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to buy advanced F-16 fighter jets from the United States. He told US President Joe Biden about this interest. But Biden gave him a counter condition. Turkey has objected to Sweden&#8217;s application to become a member of the Western military alliance NATO. Biden wants, Erdoğan will remove this objection.</p>



<p>Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics for two decades. First he was the Prime Minister of the country, then he became the President. He was elected as the President of Turkey for the third term last Sunday. Erdogan will lead the country with an important position in the international arena for the next five years.</p>



<p>Biden called yesterday Monday to congratulate Erdoğan after winning the election. In this phone conversation, Erdogan reiterated Ankara&#8217;s interest in buying F-16 fighter jets. Biden also informed him of Washington&#8217;s interest in NATO and the Sweden issue. Biden himself told the media about this conversation.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Biden told reporters at the White House, &#8216;I spoke with Erdogan. I congratulated Erdoğan. He (Erdoğan) still wants to do some work on F-16 fighter jets. I told him, we want an agreement with Sweden. Let&#8217;s do it together. We will get back to each other about it.&#8217;</p>



<p>Do you expect Erdoğan to take any initiative on Sweden joining NATO? Reporters ask Biden. In response, Biden said, &#8216;I raised the issue with him (Erdoğan). There will be further discussions between the US and Turkey on this next week.&#8217;</p>



<p>Sweden and Finland have been following the principle of neutrality in international politics for a long time. But after the beginning of the Russian attack on Ukraine in February last year, there was a change in the neutral policy of the two countries. Finland and Sweden think that Moscow can attack their countries as well. So the two countries want to join NATO for advance security. Because, if a member country is attacked, the rest of the NATO members will respond simultaneously. This is the rule of this military alliance.</p>



<p>Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO last year. Türkiye objected. Another NATO rule is that adding new members requires the consent of all existing members. So the initiative got stuck due to the obstruction of NATO member Turkey.</p>



<p>Later, after muddling the waters, Türkiye became flexible about Finland. Removed the objection. As a result, Finland joined NATO. But Erdogan&#8217;s Türkiye is still adamant about Sweden. Sweden&#8217;s application is also pending. So now the US, the most influential member of NATO, is trying to convince Erdogan about Sweden.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Turkey&#8217;s interest in buying F-16 fighter jets from the US is quite old. The country is also willing to spend 2 billion dollars for this. But the US Congress objected. According to Congress, Ankara has not yet given the green signal for NATO expansion. Apart from this, questions remain about Erdoğan&#8217;s Syria policy and Turkey&#8217;s human rights situation. Therefore, the US Congress does not want to sell F-16 to Ankara for now.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Erdoğan&#8217;s office issued a statement regarding the phone conversation with Biden. It is said that the two leaders have agreed to deepen cooperation on bilateral issues. This bilateral relationship will play an important role in meeting regional and global challenges.</p>
